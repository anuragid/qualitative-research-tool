Would you say that Mozart lives a fairly healthy lifestyle? Yes. I mean, the ideal. I paused. The ideal would be if you had, like any dog, a large open space to run and roam and travel in a pack and do what they naturally would like to do. But in terms of, you know, getting a lot of exercise. We walk a lot. Yes. An incredibly healthy diet, quite expensive diet as well. So, you know, in the bigger picture for, you know, an urban dog, he lives a very healthy lifestyle. And so you might have touched on this a little bit. But what are, what are some of the things that hinder that? I mean, you know, obviously dogs in their natural habitat would, you know, be out wandering. If you had a five acre farm, that would be the ideal environment. Urban dog, he doesn't have a yard, so he's always on a leash. Being an Akita, you never leave him off leash. So he's always restrained, which, you know, I feel bad about. But not a place a dog really wants to be. Right. Do you have anything that you do, any things that help you make sure that he lives a healthy life within. The constraints that we have? You know, we do walk. I mean, obviously since he's got now developed major knee problems, started last March. Prior to that, we walked miles. Miles. And so if he gets that kind of exercise, I mean, if we can get out and walk and walk and walk, a good, you know, at least one major good couple of mile walk in the morning and then maybe a quick let out in the afternoon just around the block and then another good walk at night. Doing that. He was pretty content. He never would get restless. We play a little tug of war in the house. When he does, if he's bored, so he seems content, he goes to daycare so that he can play with other dogs and remain social. So, you know, I try to do what I can to make sure that he's getting enough exercise and enough interaction to keep him content and stable. Just have a stable personality. Yep. How often does he go to daycare. Say, prior to surgery? Because I was traveling so much for work, he was there every week. I mean, I would travel, so he would be dropped off usually, you know, Monday night or Tuesday morning and I'd pick him up Thursday night, so weekly for a couple days. All right. Are you out of town now? Post injury and like, how are you dealing with him then? Well, he actually lived with Valerie after he had. Because he basically he had a major. Even a surgeon said, I did a lot of surgery on your dog, so. Food would be another way, another thing. Well, he's been food for him has been a non stop kind of nightmare. Adopted him. They give you a bag of food and I come to find out that he has incredible allergy issues. This dog has been a walking medical problem. So I started moving, trying many, many different foods to find, find one. Finally got him on an all fish based diet and that seemed to really control, help control. Never completely eliminated, but it helped control a lot of his allergy issues. And then when the knee blew out in March of this year, that is when the food became a huge issue because his vet, his holistic vet and she did rehab on him after this first knee surgery. But after this one we're was basic knee construction. She said, you know, his healing depends upon his weight and you've got to get him down. So she said, get him off the kibble. It was amazing. He started out at 125. I got him down to about 118, just doing, you know, cutting back on portions and realizing I was probably overfeeding him. And she said 118 is still too big for him. I want him. Her and the surgeon said, you know, if you can get him down to 90, 95. When we took the kibble away, his weight dropped like a rocket. I mean it was stunning. It was absolutely stunning. And you know, outside of just the extra carbohydrates that they're in there, part of her philosophy was they're also using extra fillers and stuff to bind the kibble together. And she said when you've got such a sensitive dog with allergies like this, we don't know what's triggered. Eliminate as much as you can and keep his eating as pure as possible. So he's basically eating all fish based, all canned. It's remova and they make a cat food as well, but he gets two cans of that a day. And then with brown, brown rice, rice cakes mixed in for crunch and then constantly eating one protein source does not add enough variety for, you know, all the minerals and nutrients that pack in there. She said, I'd really like you to add in something else. So now he's getting one patty on top of his food. Is that freeze dried Stella and chewy? Is the freeze dried raw? I think it's considered raw. And he gets like a little bit of that because it makes sense when you think about it from a nutritional. If you're just eating fish all the time, right? So that's what he's getting. And it seems to be, he seems to be holding steady as you said. The holistic vet. Did you have. Was that a switch or are there two? Or were you just noting that your vet is a holistic approach? He has two. He has two. She did physical therapy, so she does a rehab. She has a whole rehab clinic. And part of the rehab includes a holistic approach. It includes a lot of, you know, trauma. I mean, I'm just trying to think of the stuff he's been on, you know, various herbs, acupuncture. But she's. She's east and west. I mean, she's a traditional vet and then went. Gotten certified and all this stuff, and she's really get into it. So he does see both because she doesn't do as much critical care. So he came down. I don't know if he ate something or if he came down with the virus. But last weekend before that, he was very, very, very sick. And because he's also asked to take a lot of rimadyl, he's taking gabapentin, all these, you know, western meds to control pain. He's got to be able to keep him down or he can't. I mean, he can't walk, period. So for him to get a virus or eat something that makes him sick is a very big deal. So, I mean, I don't take him, you know, to his holistic bet for that, because she's not set up for that kind of more urgent care where they are. So they hydrated him, they gave him an antiemetic, antidiarrheal, tried to chill his system out so he could keep his meds down. So, you know, he does see both vets. For those reasons, I probably lean more towards the holistic approach because there just seems to be a bigger arsenal available, a broader arsenal. So same thing in human medicine. I mean, throw them full of drugs, mask a problem where Barb's approach is, okay, if we have to do that, we'll do that to get them through. But let's look at underlying causes. You had also said that the vet had worked with you to choose kibble. That was the holistic vet recommendation, was, you know, here are the brands that I think are cleanest. And I think because he has so many. We've got so many allergies, let's go with something that's going to be the least likely to cause reaction, which is going to be, I guess the theory is, you know, they're eating chicken, beef, and lamb all the time while they're having allergies. Let's try fish, let's try pheasant. Let's try something that they're not commonly getting because then they might have a lower likelihood of having an allergic reaction to it. And what do you mean by clean food? The fewer ingredients the better. I mean, when you like again, you know, if you can read the ingredients in the back of your own food and understand it, it's better. So again, with the dog, with this many allergies, we don't know what's triggering him. So let's try to find something that has the least amount of additives that we possibly can and the highest amount of protein. Dog Food Advisor has a really nice website that will break down the foods and tell you, you know, carb level, protein level. They'll tell you if it's a very, well, fairly good balanced food. And how long has he been on fish then on the fish diet? He's been on fish pretty much. I've had him four years. So I would say within the first six months I had gotten him transitioned over to fish, a fish base. So he's been on fish base, kibble and now he's just on the. Just canned fish based. So you did try raw diet. Could you tell us like a little bit about that? I mean, when you think about the raw diet, I mean it does make the most sense for both cats and dogs. The problem with the raw diet, with my lifestyle is that it's not. I mean, he got violently sick off of it and I think because I bought it and let it sit out too long for my lifestyle, it just, I couldn't make it happen. And then you said you give him like two cans for per day. Yeah, he gets a can in the morning with one or two rice cakes in it because he seems to like those and it gives him some crunch, which I think is, you know, totally my psychological need. But think he needs to crunch something, but he likes them. And then now I've added in the Stella and chewies freeze dried on top just to vary the protein source and the calories, protein minerals, whatever. So then how do you get to the point where you knew kind of you had to feed him like two cans? Did the vet recommend two cans? Okay. Yep. And was that a significant change from when what you used to feed him. Before, like the amount of. How much like the amount of food you used to feed him? You know what I would say? Probably, yeah. I mean I was probably. I mean if you go on the back of what these bags say, I have come to find out you are grossly overfeeding your dog. Grossly. And I was following the guidelines and that he just kept getting bigger and bigger. The vets were like, no, no, no, no, no, get him down. So, you know, from 118 to 90 today was 98. And he's a hungry boy. I mean, you saw how he's with treats. I mean, this is not a lot of food. He is hungry. So when their suggestion was to get him lower, I said, absolutely not. I'm not gonna starve my dog. I mean, if he can vacillate between 95 and 98 pounds, I just don't, I just don't see it's fair to him because he's hungry. I mean, all the time I feel bad for him. And then do you ever give him like table scraps or human food? No. So you think with the weight loss it's mostly like food related then? Absolutely. If I can keep him between 95 and 100, he's at a very good weight. I mean, no one's saying that they love his weight. They're like, he's at a great weight. A little bit less would be better. And you know, to me, it's also a quality of life issue. He's so hungry all the time now. It doesn't seem worth it to me to get him. If I can keep him between 95 and 98, to get him down to 90 and starve him to death. Yeah, I'm not doing it. He's just too hungry. So you mentioned you travel a lot and then do you, does he accompany you on trips? No, he does not. I mean, if I'm going, you know, out to see family, generally I'll take him with. But for work related things, no, he goes to Valerie for his daycare and he's like I said, that's his home away from home. He's very comfortable there. Or do you treat often for the. Rest of the day? He is so spoiled. He does come in and when he comes in for a walk, he gets a treat. But I changed that dramatically because I found out the treats that I was treating him with before were zooks and he loved them because they're all carrot based. But I didn't realize that even the mini ones are like 300 calories, 900 calories of those a day. So, you know, those had to go. So he now gets. His treats are just little tiny fish based wheat free biscuits. And sometimes he'll even break those in half. So he thinks he's getting two, but he's really getting one. And then I know when we were coming in you mentioned that, like, you took him out for a massage today. So how often do you do this? Part of his rehab therapy was to go and do water, go into the water tank and do treadmill in the water. And he went backwards. I said, I brought him back in and we just did another evaluation. And it was her decision. If he doesn't respond to it, he doesn't respond to it, we'll change the therapy. And she said, the only thing I think we can do, laser. So he goes in laser once a week. And she said, if you can get him in for a massage, because they. It helps just the blood flow to all the tissue. So once again, it's all back to the holistic approach. It's like, you know, I mean, I had a Norwegian alcon that I did chiropractic work on. He went from having a really hard time holding his head to being like this. You described some of these therapies as, you know, kind of crazy. Given the dog or maybe as compared to the way that you. Number of these therapies you allow yourself. Is there a limit? No, I take that back. I retract that there is a limit. When it gets to the point that I'm going to make him suffer more than it is fair, then you have to let go. Do you think after, eventually, when his knee heals, would you increase the amount he eats or something like that? Just get back to that, or would you like to? I think this, this is the amount of healing we're gonna get. I mean, he has. This is our, you know, the new normal. And, you know, we're still. I'm not giving up on increasing, trying to increase his mobility. If I can't fix it with stem cell therapy, if I can't fix it with, you know, something that's gonna reduce inflammation, then, you know, we limit the walking. Is there one particular place you'll get the food or do you just order it online or how does it work? I go to Kreiser's. I'm pretty loyal to Kreiser's. They're convenient. They've been very good to work with. The one on Clyborne, the manager is awesome. He's very knowledgeable. So they've been very helpful. They carry the brands that, you know, well, you know, Barb's like, you know, she gives me a list, both with the cat and the dogs. Here are the foods that we've evaluated. We lean towards choosing these brands. So these are the ones we like. So there's usually a list and I pick off the list. And I can always get it at Chrysler. So what about you? Do you think you eat healthy? Personally? Yes. Okay, yes, I eat very healthy. I eat too much, but I eat very healthy. Okay, so what does that mean? Like that means, you know, limited meat. It means organic for the most part. Baked fruit and vegetable base. Do you supplement him? He gets cozaquin, he gets rimadyl. So that's like a glucosamine. The supplements he gets are supplements for his orthopedic issues. So yeah, I haven't done vitamins. I do have some probiotics in the house. I mean I'm not, you know, I gotta force myself to take vitamins again. So it probably parallels my own thing. So, you know, I figure if I'm getting, if he's getting healthier food, he's getting better balanced food. And it has. Not really, if I think about it hasn't really come up with his holistic vet. You also have a book up there that I took that still photo of. Oh, the Mozart log he was on. I mean, you know, remember this is two surgeries since March. So he was on all kinds of drugs and he's on allergy meds. He's on, you know, whole dyslexia twice a day. He was taking gabapentin three times a day, Rimadyl twice a day. He's on saloxin because his low thyroid, I couldn't keep track of it. So I got a little calendar and I just wrote down so that I could look and say, okay, did I give him his, you know, his gabapentin and at what time I gave it. Because there was also he was on a lot of pain medicine medication that had to be timed specifically. So it was the only way that I could make sure I wasn't overdosing him or underdosing him. Well, especially when I travel to, I mean I just, I hand that and. You can hand that. I can hand that to her and say, you know, not everything fits in there. Like he's got the rheumato chewable, won't fit in there, but I'll put those in a baggie. But at least it helps her to see what he's had and what he needs on a day by day basis. Sliding would be very, very dangerous for him. So I went out and bought all these non stick back rugs to spread them out so he, so he can go from rug to rug to rug without sliding. Because if he slid it would be, it could be a very bad thing for him to slide out on that knee. It was really funny. One of the kids in the neighborhood came running. Came running up and said, can I pet Mozart? And I said, sure, because he really likes kids and he's petting. And he goes, everyone knows Mozart. He's famous. Well, you getting a nice tail shot? Yeah.
