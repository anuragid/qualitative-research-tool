   - Worker Service: 1 task running (revision 8, stable)
   - Task Definitions:
     - `qualitative-research-api:8` (with project state system and error_message field)
     - Both services using the same unified task definition

2. **Container Registry**: ECR repository with AMD64 Docker image
   - Latest image: `amd64-20251106-180359`
   - Fixed startup script with dynamic DATABASE_URL parsing

3. **Load Balancer**: Application Load Balancer with health checks

6. **S3 Buckets**:
   - `qualitative-research-videos-ad` (video storage)
   - `qualitative-research-frontend` (static website)

7. **Security Groups & Networking**: Configured for secure communication

### Key Issues Resolved During Deployment

1. **App Runner Health Check Failures**: Switched to ECS Fargate with proper health check configuration
2. **Docker Platform Mismatch**: Rebuilt image for linux/amd64 instead of ARM
3. **CloudWatch Permissions**: Added logging permissions to ECS task execution role
4. **Redis Configuration**: Used ElastiCache without cluster mode for Celery compatibility
5. **CORS Misconfiguration**: Fixed origin URLs and added S3 CORS rules
6. **Redis Network Access**: Created security group and configured VPC rules
7. **Frontend API Hardcoding**: Fixed environment variable usage in React app
8. **Mixed Task Definitions**: Cleaned up old deployments with incorrect settings

### Files Created

```
/aws-deployment/
├── api-task-definition.json      # ECS task definition for API
├── worker-task-definition.json   # ECS task definition for Celery
├── deploy.sh                      # Deployment automation script
└── elasticache-config.json       # Redis configuration

/frontend/
└── .env.production               # Production API endpoint
```

### Current Status - FULLY OPERATIONAL ✅

- ✅ **Frontend**: All UI features working, no errors
- ✅ **API**: 2 healthy instances serving all endpoints
- ✅ **Celery Workers**: Processing all background tasks successfully
- ✅ **Database**: RDS PostgreSQL with multiple test projects and videos
- ✅ **Redis Queue**: ElastiCache handling all task queuing
- ✅ **Health Checks**: All passing continuously
- ✅ **Load Balancer**: Distributing traffic perfectly
- ✅ **Complete Feature Set Working**:
  - Project management (CRUD) ✅
  - Video upload to S3 ✅
  - Transcription via AssemblyAI ✅
  - 5-step analysis (CHUNK → INFER → RELATE → EXPLAIN → ACTIVATE) ✅
  - Cross-video project analysis ✅
  - Speaker identification ✅
  - Video playback with presigned URLs ✅
  - Real-time status updates ✅

### Verified Working Examples
- **Video ID**: `dfaeb844-a284-444d-939c-562a746807d6` - Fully analyzed with 111 chunks, 8 insights
- **Video ID**: `f41db1e4-e4a1-4ee1-a4d3-c52abb513363` - Successfully transcribed
- **Multiple test projects created and functioning**

### Important Notes

1. **Local Environment Unchanged**: Your local demo setup on localhost:5173 remains completely untouched and operational

2. **Data Separation**:
   - Local database: Contains all real production data (7 projects, 3 videos)
   - AWS database: Contains test data only (1 test project)
   - These are completely separate - no data sharing

3. **Shared S3**: Both local and AWS use the same S3 bucket for video storage

### Monthly Cost Estimate

- ECS Fargate: ~$65-90
- ElastiCache Redis: ~$12
- RDS Database: ~$15
- Load Balancer: ~$21
- S3 & Data Transfer: ~$10
- **Total: ~$125-160/month**

### Quick Management Commands

```bash
# Check service status
aws ecs describe-services --cluster qualitative-research-prod --services api workers --region us-east-2

# View logs
aws logs tail /ecs/qualitative-research-api --region us-east-2 --since 30m

# Scale services
aws ecs update-service --cluster qualitative-research-prod --service api --desired-count 3 --region us-east-2

# Update frontend
cd frontend && npm run build && aws s3 sync dist/ s3://qualitative-research-frontend/ --delete

# Stop services (to save costs when not needed)
aws ecs update-service --cluster qualitative-research-prod --service api --desired-count 0 --region us-east-2
aws ecs update-service --cluster qualitative-research-prod --service workers --desired-count 0 --region us-east-2
```

### Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Configure Auto-scaling**: Set up automatic scaling based on CPU/memory metrics
2. **Add Custom Domain**: Use Route53 for a custom domain name
3. **Enable HTTPS**: Add SSL certificate via AWS Certificate Manager
4. **Set Up Monitoring**: CloudWatch dashboards and alarms
5. **Migrate Data**: Move production data from local to AWS when ready
6. **Optimize Costs**: Consider Fargate Spot, Reserved Instances

### For New Chat Context

When starting a new chat, mention:
- "I have a Qualitative Research Tool deployed on AWS ECS Fargate"
- "Frontend on S3, Backend on ECS, Redis on ElastiCache, PostgreSQL on RDS"
- "Local development still running separately on localhost"
- "Need help with [specific task like monitoring, scaling, data migration, etc.]"

- **AWS Production**: Live deployment for real usage
- **Clear separation**: Never develop directly on production

### NEW Unified Deployment Process:
```bash
# Start local (mirrors AWS)
./scripts/start-local.sh
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Make changes and test locally
# Everything runs in Docker containers just like AWS

# Deploy to AWS (with validation)
./scripts/deploy-to-aws.sh
```
